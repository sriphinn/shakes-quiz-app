## About The Project

This is one of my first projects built during my Thinkful Software Engineering Bootcamp. I'm a fan of period pieces and love the ridiculousness of "The Great" by Tony McNamara. Fans of the show will understand the cheekiness of this quiz. 

- Developed single-purpose template generation and event handler functions in JavaScript.
- Built using semantic HTML, CSS and jQuery.
- Implemented render() function to conditionally regenerate the view when store is updated.
